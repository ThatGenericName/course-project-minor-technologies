Thirty years ago, Niki Lauda told us \u2018take a monkey, \nplace him into the cockpit and he is able to drive the car.\u2019 Thirty years later, Sebastian told us \u2018I had to start \nmy car like a computer, it\u2019s very complicated.\u2019 And Nico Rosberg said that during the race \u2013 I don\u2019t \nremember what race - he pressed the wrong button on the wheel.
