Listing Description: Vorp Some Placeholder Text for com.minortechnologies.workr_frontend.demo Listing 4 Search Term
 This is a copypasta from Formula 1 in 2016 
30 years ago,Gentlemen, a short view back to the past. Thirty years ago, Niki Lauda told us ‘take a monkey, 
place him into the cockpit and he is able to drive the car.’ Thirty years later, Sebastian told us ‘I had to start 
my car like a computer, it’s very complicated.’ And Nico Rosberg said that during the race – I don’t 
remember what race - he pressed the wrong button on the wheel. Question for you both: is Formula 
One driving today too complicated with twenty and more buttons on the wheel, are you too much 
under effort, under pressure? What are your wishes for the future concerning the technical 
programme during the race? Less buttons, more? Or less and more communication with your 
engineers?
